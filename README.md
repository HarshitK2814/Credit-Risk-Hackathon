## 📖 1. Project Overview

Traditional credit ratings are **slow, opaque, and outdated** often lag behind real-world events. **CredLens** is a modern solution to this problem. It's a **real-time, explainable credit intelligence platform** that ingests High-frequency **market data**, Fundamental **financial metrics**, and Unstructured **news headlines** data to generate a dynamic and **transparent Stability Score**.

Our platform moves beyond a simple "black box" prediction. It provides deep, feature-level explanations for every score, empowering analysts to understand the "why" behind the number and make truly informed decisions.

## ✨2. Key Features

* ✅ **Multi-Source Data Ingestion:** Ingests data from three distinct sources: **Yahoo Finance** (structured market/fundamental data), **FRED** (structured macroeconomic data), and **NewsAPI** (unstructured news headlines).
* ✅ **"Fundamentals First" Hybrid Scoring Model:** A unique two-part architecture that anchors a company's score in its fundamental financial health and then applies a penalty based on a sophisticated, AI-driven technical risk assessment.
* ✅ **Advanced Explainable AI (XAI):** Uses the industry-standard SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to provide clear, feature-level breakdowns of what drives each score, making the model's reasoning transparent.
* ✅ **Interactive & Polished Dashboard:** A fluid and intuitive Streamlit UI featuring interactive score gauges, a "Feature Deep Dive" explorer for historical trend analysis, and sentiment-highlighted news headlines.
* ✅ **Intelligent & Robust Fallbacks:** The system is fully resilient. It gracefully handles API failures and can produce a qualitative, rule-based **Heuristic Assessment** for stocks that cannot be scored by the ML model due to insufficient data.
* ✅ **Lightweight MLOps Pipeline:** The entire backend is containerized with **Docker** for perfect reproducibility. It includes an API endpoint to trigger automated background retraining of core models, ensuring the system's intelligence stays fresh without any downtime.

## 🏗️3. System Architecture

Our platform utilizes a modern, decoupled architecture for scalability and maintainability.

*   **Frontend:** A responsive dashboard built with **Streamlit** and deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud.
*   **Backend:** A high-performance API server built with **FastAPI** and deployed as a Docker container on Railway.
*   **ML Engine:** Uses **XGBoost** for the specialized technical model and **Optuna** for efficient, intelligent hyperparameter optimization.

## ⚖️4. Key Architectural Decisions & Trade-offs

This project's final architecture is the result of solving several complex, real-world challenges.

#### 🔹1. The Challenge: A Flawed, Biased Model
*   **Problem:** Our initial models exhibited a strong "mean-reversion bias," giving dangerously high scores (90+) to volatile stocks like `SMCI` that had recently crashed, ignoring obvious fundamental risks.
*   **Decision:** We abandoned the single-model approach and re-architected to a **"Fundamentals First" two-part system.** A stable, rule-based `fundamental_score` (based on debt, profitability, etc.) acts as an anchor. A specialized `technical_model` then calculates a `technical_penalty` based on market risk. The final score is `fundamental_score - technical_penalty`.
*   **Outcome:** This completely eliminated the bias. A company with poor fundamentals can now **never** achieve a high score, regardless of its market behavior. This makes the final score far more robust and trustworthy.

#### 🔹2. The Challenge: Real-Time Updates vs. UI Latency
*   **Problem:** Retraining a model on every request would provide maximum data freshness but would cause an unacceptable 15-30 second delay in the UI.
*   **Decision:** We implemented a **hybrid training architecture** using FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks`. The user receives an instant score based on the latest data applied to a pre-trained model. In the background, an asynchronous task is triggered to retrain the model with that new data.
*   **Outcome:** The UI is instantaneous, while the model's intelligence is continuously updated, providing the best of both worlds.

## 📊5. Model Performance & Explainability

Our model's goal is to predict periods of future negative returns combined with high volatility. We use a holdout test set and achieve realistic, powerful AUC scores. For example, for a stock like **NVDA**, the model achieved a **Final Test Set AUC Score of ~0.91**.

The platform's core strength is its explainability, which allows an analyst to understand the reasoning behind any score.

## ⚙️6. How to Run Locally

1️⃣  **Clone Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-url]
    cd [your-repo-folder]
    ```

2️⃣  **Set Up Environment:**
    *   Create a Python virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
    *   Activate it: `.\venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows) or `source venv/bin/activate` (Mac/Linux)
    *   Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3️⃣  **Configure API Keys:**
    *   In the root directory, create a file named `.env`.
    *   Add your secret keys to this file:
      ```
      NEWS_API_KEY="YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY"
      FRED_API_KEY="YOUR_FRED_API_KEY"
      ```

4️⃣  **Run the Application:**
    *   **Terminal 1 (Backend):** `uvicorn backend.main:app --reload`
    *   **Terminal 2 (Frontend):** `streamlit run frontend/app.py`

5️⃣  Open your browser to the local Streamlit URL 👉 (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## 🏆 Why CredLens Stands Out  

✨ **Transparent & Explainable → From "Black Box" to Glass Box**  
We don't just provide a score; we provide the reasoning. Using **SHAP** and a clear UI, analysts can instantly see the specific drivers — from market volatility to fundamental debt — that influenced the final number. This builds trust and transforms the platform from a simple predictor into a true intelligence tool.  

✨ **Robust & Reliable → A "Fundamentals First" Architecture**  
Our biggest innovation is our **two-part scoring system**. A stable, rule-based **Fundamental Score** acts as a powerful anchor, preventing the model from being fooled by irrational market hype or biased technical signals. This guarantees that a company with poor financial health can never receive a misleadingly high score — solving a critical flaw found in simpler models.  

✨ **Real-Time Insights, Zero Latency → A Hybrid Training Model**  
Our platform is built for the **now**. It provides **instantaneous scores** based on the latest available data, but intelligently queues up a **full model retraining in the background** using FastAPI's asynchronous tasks. This gives the user a **real-time experience without lag**, while ensuring the system's intelligence is constantly refreshed.  

✨ **Production-Ready & Resilient → Built for the Real World**  
The entire backend is **containerized with Docker** for reproducibility and deployed securely using environment variables. The system is resilient to failure, automatically falling back to a **heuristic assessment** if an ML model cannot be trained — ensuring the user always gets a useful insight.

🔥 **CredLens is not just another score generator — it’s the future of explainable, real-time credit intelligence.**  


## 3. System Architecture & Design

CredLens is built on a modern, decoupled, and scalable architecture designed for real-time performance, resilience, and maintainability. The system is composed of two primary services: a Streamlit frontend for the user interface and a FastAPI backend for all data processing and machine learning logic.
